[statement1]Hello there! <yay> My name is Chili and this is <tilt-left> Bandit! 
[statement2]The Interaction Lab focuses on developing computational principles 
[statement3]and techniques to enable social, human-robot interaction.
[statement4]<forward> Professor Maja MatariÄ‡ and her students conduct research in an  
[statement5]interdisciplinary arena that applies computer science and engineering to 
[statement6]assist in  mitigating critical societal problems.  
[statement7]<backward> More recent work investigates the impact of long-term and  
[statement8]personalized Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) to increase quality of life, 
[statement9]health,communication, autonomy, and educational goals.
[statement10]Thank you for visiting the lab today! <hooray>
